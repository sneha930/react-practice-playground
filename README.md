# React Challenge â€” Color List App
Build a React app that:
Has an input field where users can type the name of a color (e.g., "red", "blue", "teal").
Has an "Add Color" button that adds the typed color to a list.
Displays the list of colors as colored boxes with the color name shown.
Clicking on any color box removes that color from the list.
The app prevents adding empty or duplicate color names.
Uses the useState hook to manage input and the color list.
Style the buttons and color boxes with some basic styling (you can use Tailwind CSS if you want).
