# React Challenge â€” Color List App
Build a React app that:
Has an input field where users can type the name of a color (e.g., "red", "blue", "teal").
Has an "Add Color" button that adds the typed color to a list.
Displays the list of colors as colored boxes with the color name shown.
Clicking on any color box removes that color from the list.
